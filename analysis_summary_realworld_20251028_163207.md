### [BUG] Issue #1584: [Bug]: while doing sign up , It also accepting  Invalid Emails

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1584

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**Analysis**

### 1. Root Cause Analysis:

The root cause of the issue is that the server-side validation for email and username in the `index.post.ts` file only checks if the fields are not null or undefined, but does not verify if they contain a valid email address.

### 2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:

To reproduce the bug:
1. Send a POST request to `/api/users` with a JSON body containing an invalid email (e.g., "invalidemail") and a username.
2. Verify that the server-side validation does not detect any errors and creates a new user with the provided invalid email.

### 3. Affected Code Paths:

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/users/index.post.ts` - The file responsible for validating and creating new users.

### 4. Complete Fix (Patch):

+}

 if (!username) {
     throw new HttpException(422, {errors: {username: ["can't be blank"]}});
 }
```

### 5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:

1. Test the email and username validation with valid and invalid inputs.
2. Verify that the server-side validation detects errors for invalid emails (e.g., missing "@", wrong domain) and usernames (e.g., empty strings, special characters).

### 6. Potential Side Effects:

* The fix might introduce a new potential issue if the email regex pattern is not correctly configured or updated in the future.
* It's essential to ensure that the email regex pattern remains up-to-date to accommodate changing email address formats and avoid false positives/negatives.

By implementing this fix, we can prevent invalid emails from being accepted during user sign-up, ensuring a more robust and secure authentication process.

### [BUG] Issue #1374: [Bug]: Continuous modification of user information results in an error

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1374

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that when updating a user's information, the username from the token is used to find the user to be updated. This causes an error because the old username is still present in the token, and there is no matching record found in the database.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
1. Update a user's information using the `/api/users/:id` endpoint.
2. Get the updated user's information with the new username.
3. Try to update the same user's information again without changing any details.
4. The API returns an error with a status code of 500 and displays the message "Invalid prisma.user.update() invocation: ...".

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
- `apps/api/server/routes/api/user/index.put.ts` (update user endpoint)
- `apps/api/server/utils/prisma.ts` (Prisma client utility file)

### [BUG] Issue #1054: [Bug]: Line breaks not showing correctly

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1054

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is not directly related to the provided code context. The description suggests that the problem lies in how the dummy articles were entered into the database, which affects how line breaks are represented in the response body.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
As this is a backend issue and the problem seems to be with data stored in the database, it's not possible to provide step-by-step reproduction steps using the provided code context.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
No specific files or functions are directly related to the reported bug. The issue appears to be related to how articles were entered into the database and how this affects the response body representation of line breaks.

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**

This fix involves modifying the JSON object returned by the API to include HTML line breaks (`<br />`) in the `body` field of article responses.

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Verify that the fix does not affect other parts of the application.
2. Confirm that the modified response includes correct line breaks for articles with multiple paragraphs.
3. Check that the frontend correctly handles and displays these HTML line breaks in article bodies.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
This fix could potentially introduce issues if there are any existing filters or logic that rely on the original representation of line breaks in the `body` field. Care should be taken to ensure that no unforeseen consequences arise from this change.

### [BUG] Issue #839: [Bug]: expectation order of the tags in the tests is incorrect. 

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/839

**GitHub Issue Analysis**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that the expected order of tags in the tests does not match the actual order in the API response. The test expects the tag `dragons` to be in the first place, while the actual API response has the tag `training` as the first one.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce this bug:

1. Make a request to the `/api/tags` endpoint.
2. Verify that the returned list of tags is sorted alphabetically (e.g., `dragons` comes before `training`).

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are in the file `apps/api/server/routes/api/tags/index.get.ts`, specifically the line where the `tags` array is sorted:

```typescript
orderBy: {
    articles: {
        _count: 'desc',
    },
},
```

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**
To fix this issue, we need to change the sorting logic in the API endpoint to sort tags by their creation timestamp instead of alphabetically. Here's the corrected code:

```diff
@@ -12,7 +12,7 @@

     const queries = [];
     queries.push({ demo: true });

     if (auth) {
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**
To prevent regression, we need to add test cases that specifically validate the fix for this bug. Here are some examples:

* Test case 1: Verify that the tags are sorted by creation timestamp.
```javascript
it('should sort tags by creation timestamp', async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/tags');
    const tags = await response.json();
    expect(tags).toBeSortedBy('createdAt');
});
```

* Test case 2: Verify that the tag `dragons` is in its correct position in the sorted list.
```javascript
it('should have dragons in its correct position', async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/tags');
    const tags = await response.json();
    expect(tags).toContain('dragons');
});
```

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
One potential side effect of this fix is that the order of tags may change, which could affect any code that relies on a specific sorting order. We should review and test our code to ensure that it continues to function correctly after this fix.

### [BUG] Issue #832: [Bug]: Regex in Postman collection rejects valid ISO-8601 timestamps

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/832

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is an incorrect regular expression (regex) used in the Postman collection. The regex pattern `^\d{4,}-[01]\d-[0-3]\dT[0-2]\d:[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d.\d+(?:[+-][0-2]\d:[0-5]\d|Z)$` is not correctly matching ISO 8601 timestamps. The issue is that the regex requires a decimal subsecond segment but matches on the decimal separator using an unescaped `.` which matches any single character instead of an escaped `\.` matching a literal dot.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:

1. Use Postman to send a request with a valid ISO 8601 timestamp in the "createdAt" property.
2. The request should be rejected by the regex used in the Postman collection.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code path is the regex pattern used in the Postman collection, specifically `^\d{4,}-[01]\d-[0-3]\dT[0-2]\d:[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d.\d+(?:[+-][0-2]\d:[0-5]\d|Z)$`.

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**
To fix the issue, we can modify the regex pattern to make the subsecond fragment optional and correctly match ISO 8601 timestamps. Here is the updated regex pattern:

```diff

-export interface Comment {
+export interface Comment {
   id: number;
   createdAt: Date;
   updatedAt: Date;
   body: string;
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**
To prevent regression, we can add test cases to validate the fix for the reported bug. Here are some sample test cases:

* Test case 1: Send a request with a valid ISO 8601 timestamp and verify that it is accepted by the regex.
* Test case 2: Send a request with an invalid timestamp format (e.g., missing or extra characters) and verify that it is rejected by the regex.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
After implementing this fix, we should double-check that other parts of our code are not affected. Specifically, we should ensure that any other code that uses ISO 8601 timestamps for parsing or matching is not impacted by this change.

### [BUG] Issue #681: On Update User Endpoint, 'NULL' for the password field in the request body is being accepted which should not happen

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/681

**GitHub Issue Analysis**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that the `password` field in the request body is not being validated correctly in the `Update User` endpoint (`PUT /api/user`). Specifically, when a null value is passed for the password, it should throw an error response with a 422 status code. However, due to the absence of validation checks, the password remains null, and subsequent login attempts fail.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce the bug:

1. Send a PUT request to `/api/user` with the following JSON payload:
```json
{
  "user": {
    "email": "jake@jake.jake",
    "bio": "I like to skateboard",
    "image": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/xHWG8.jpg"
  }
}
```
2. Set the `password` field to null.
3. Observe that the password remains null in the database, and subsequent login attempts fail.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/user/index.put.ts`: The `Update User` endpoint does not validate the `password` field correctly.

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**

```diff

+   }
    
    // ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Send a PUT request with a valid `email` and `username` but no `password`. Verify that an error response with a 422 status code is returned.
2. Send a PUT request with a null `password` field. Verify that an error response with a 422 status code is returned.
3. Send a PUT request with a non-null `password` field. Verify that the password is correctly updated in the database.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
None expected. This fix only affects the validation of the `password` field in the `Update User` endpoint and does not introduce any new side effects.
