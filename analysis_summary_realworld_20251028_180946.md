All backend implementations need to adhere to our [API spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/specifications/backend).

For your convenience, we have a [Postman collection](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/blob/main/api/Conduit.postman_collection.json) that you can use to test your API endpoints as you build your app.

Check out our [starter kit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit) to create a new implementation, please read [references to the API specs & testing](/specifications/backend/introduction) required for creating a new backend.
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Verify that the link points to the correct URL by checking the documentation.
2. Test the link by clicking on it and verifying that it takes you to the correct API specification page.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
None expected, as this fix only updates a broken link in the documentation.

### [BUG] Issue #1584: [Bug]: while doing sign up , It also accepting  Invalid Emails

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1584

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is the lack of email validation in the sign-up and login endpoints. The code is accepting invalid emails without checking if they contain the `@` symbol, which is a crucial part of an email address.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Go to the registration page.
2. Enter an email address without the `@` symbol (e.g., "jakejake").
3. Submit the form.
4. The endpoint will create a new user with the invalid email address.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/users/index.post.ts`: This is where the email validation should be implemented.
* `apps/api/server/routes/api/users/login.post.ts`: This endpoint also needs to validate emails correctly.

### [BUG] Issue #1374: [Bug]: Continuous modification of user information results in an error

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1374

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of this issue is that the API is consuming the token with the old username on subsequent updates, which leads to an error because the user to be updated is not found. This happens because the username from the token is used to find the user to be updated, but the username has changed after the first update.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Initially, a user's information is modified and a new token with the updated username is generated.
2. On subsequent updates, the API consumes the old token which still contains the previous username.
3. The API uses this old username to find the user to be updated, but since the username has changed, the user is not found, leading to an error.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/user/index.put.ts` (updateUser function)
* `apps/api/server/utils/prisma.ts` (usePrisma function)

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Test that the API correctly updates a user's information and generates a new token.
2. Test that the API consumes the new token on subsequent updates and finds the correct user.
3. Test that the API handles errors when the user is not found.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

* None, as this fix only stores the updated username and uses it to generate the token in subsequent updates.

### [BUG] Issue #1054: [Bug]: Line breaks not showing correctly

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/1054

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The issue is related to the representation of line breaks in the API response format. The problem arises when the response contains multiple lines, which are represented as `\n` instead of `<br />`. This issue is not specific to a particular endpoint or function but rather an inconsistency in how line breaks are handled.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Make a GET request to the API endpoint for a single article.
2. Inspect the response and look for instances where multiple lines of text are concatenated without any explicit line breaks.
3. Observe that these line breaks are represented as `\n` instead of `<br />`.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

The affected code paths include:

* `apps/documentation/src/content/docs/specifications/backend/api-response-format.md`: The JSON objects returned by the API, particularly in the `Single Article` and `Multiple Articles` sections.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`: The Samples section contains examples of API responses that may exhibit this issue.

### Multiple Articles

:::
```
Note: This patch updates the `Single Article` section to use HTML line breaks (`<br />`) instead of `\n`.

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

Test cases:

1. Verify that the updated API response format correctly represents line breaks as `<br />`.
2. Test multiple article responses to ensure that each article has proper line breaks.
3. Check that single-line breaks are still ignored, but only when followed by another single-line break (i.e., `\n\n` is treated as a new paragraph).

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

Potential risks or areas to double-check:

* Verify that the fix does not introduce any inconsistencies in how line breaks are handled across different API endpoints.
* Ensure that any affected code paths, such as parsing or rendering functions, are updated to correctly handle HTML line breaks.

This patch should address the issue of inconsistent line break representation in the API response format.

### [BUG] Issue #839: [Bug]: expectation order of the tags in the tests is incorrect. 

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/839

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that the tag list in the tests is expected to be sorted alphabetically, whereas the actual logic for sorting tags in the `index.get.ts` file is based on the count of articles with each tag in descending order.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Run the Postman collection against the API.
2. Verify that the expected order of tags in the response does not match the actual order.
3. Inspect the `index.get.ts` file and note that it uses the count of articles with each tag to sort the tags.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/tags/index.get.ts`
* The relevant Postman collection tests

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

* Verify that the sorted order of tags in the response matches the expected alphabetical order.
* Test edge cases such as when there are multiple tags with the same count or when no articles have been created.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
This fix does not introduce any new side effects, but it may affect the performance of the API if the number of tags grows significantly. In this case, additional optimization techniques could be applied to improve the sorting algorithm's efficiency.

### [BUG] Issue #832: [Bug]: Regex in Postman collection rejects valid ISO-8601 timestamps

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/832

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is an incorrect regular expression (regex) used in the Postman collection to validate ISO 8601 timestamps. The regex pattern does not correctly match timestamps with optional subsecond segments.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce the bug:

* Create a timestamp using the `time` crate in Rust, such as `2021-12-14T03:09:36+00:00`.
* Use this timestamp as input for the regex pattern.
* The regex pattern should reject the timestamp due to its incorrect matching of subsecond segments.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `apps/documentation/src/content/docs/specifications/backend/Conduit.postman_collection.json`
* The regex pattern used in this file is:
```json
^\d{4,}-[01]\d-[0-3]\dT[0-2]\d:[0-5]\d:[0-5]\d.\d+(?:[+-][0-2]\d:[0-5]\d|Z)$
```
**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**
Here is the complete fix as a git diff in the unified format:

```
The fix is to modify the regex pattern to make the subsecond segment optional by adding `(\.\d+)?` at the end.

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**
To prevent regression, test cases should be added to verify that the fix works correctly:

* Create a timestamp with a subsecond segment (e.g., `2021-12-14T03:09:36.123Z`) and ensure it is accepted by the regex pattern.
* Create a timestamp without a subsecond segment (e.g., `2021-12-14T03:09:36Z`) and ensure it is also accepted by the regex pattern.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
After implementing this fix, potential side effects to double-check include:

* Verify that the fix does not introduce any new bugs or performance issues.
* Test the fix with various timestamp formats and edge cases to ensure its correctness.

### [BUG] Issue #689: Show placeholder image to represent the currently logged in user without a specified profile image on navbar and new comment form

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/689

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that when a user does not have a profile image set, the placeholder image (https://static.productionready.io/images/smiley-cyrus.jpg) is not displayed correctly in certain locations, such as the login image next to the name on the navbar and the image next to the "Post Comment" button on article pages.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
1. Log in as a user without a profile image set.
2. Go to the navbar and click on the dropdown menu where the profile image should be displayed.
3. Observe that the placeholder image is not shown.
4. Go to an article page and click on the "Post Comment" button.
5. Observe that the placeholder image next to the comment form is also not shown.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
* `apps\api\server\models\profile.model.ts`: The Profile interface defines a property called `image`, which is expected to be a string representing the user's profile image URL.
* `apps\documentation\src\content\docs\specifications\frontend\templates.md`: The template code uses an `<img>` tag with a hardcoded placeholder image URL (http://i.imgur.com/Qr71crq.jpg) when displaying the user's profile image.
* `apps\documentation\src\content\docs\specifications\backend\endpoints.md`: The API endpoints for retrieving articles and comments do not include the user's profile image in their responses.

### [BUG] Issue #681: On Update User Endpoint, 'NULL' for the password field in the request body is being accepted which should not happen

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/681

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of this issue is the lack of validation on the `password` field in the `index.put.ts` file when updating a user's password. The existing code allows null or empty passwords to be passed, which should not happen.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Send a PUT request to `/api/user` with an empty password field in the request body.
2. The server will update the user's password without hashing it, making it null.
3. Subsequent login attempts will fail because the password is null.

### [BUG] Issue #647: Allow favoring your own posts from the post page

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/647

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that the favorite button is not visible on the post page when the user tries to favorite their own post. This is because the backend API routes (`api/articles/[slug]/index.delete.ts` and `api/articles/[slug]/favorite/index.delete.ts`) are designed to prevent users from favoriting their own posts by checking if the author's ID matches the authenticated user's ID.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Log in to the application as a registered user.
2. Navigate to an article page that you have created (i.e., it shows your username).
3. Try to favorite your own post by clicking on the favorite button.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `api/articles/[slug]/index.delete.ts`
* `api/articles/[slug]/favorite/index.post.ts`

These files contain the logic for deleting and favoriting articles, respectively.

* Test case 2: As a registered user, log in and navigate to an article page that belongs to another user. Try to favorite that post.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

* Make sure that the logic for adding the favorite button is correctly implemented to avoid any potential bugs or security vulnerabilities.
* Verify that the backend API routes are updated correctly to allow users to favorite their own posts.
* Test the application thoroughly to ensure that there are no regression issues after implementing this fix.

### [BUG] Issue #630: The Settings page requires the email and password fields regardless of whether their changed

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/630

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of the issue is that the API requires both email and password fields to be updated even when only non-sensitive information like username, bio, or image is being changed. This is because the `index.put.ts` file in the `api/user` route checks for the presence of all these fields and updates them accordingly.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:

1. Send a PUT request to `/api/user` with a JSON body containing only the non-sensitive information like username, bio, or image.
2. The API will update the user's profile, but it will also overwrite their email and password if they were previously updated.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

The affected code paths are in the `index.put.ts` file, specifically in the following function:

```typescript
export default definePrivateEventHandler(async (event, {auth}) => {
    // ...
    const updatedUser = await usePrisma().user.update({
        where: {
            id: auth.id,
        },
        data: {
            ...(email ? {email} : {}),
            //(username ? {username} : {}),

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

Here are some test cases that specifically validate the fix for the reported bug:

* Send a PUT request to `/api/user` with a JSON body containing only non-sensitive information like username, bio, or image.
* Verify that the API updates the user's profile without overwriting their email and password if they were previously updated.
* Repeat steps 1-2 but this time include sensitive fields (email, password) in the request body. Verify that the API still updates the user's profile without overwriting non-sensitive fields.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

The fix does not introduce any new side effects, but it is essential to double-check the API's behavior after implementing this fix, especially when dealing with sensitive information like email and password.

### [BUG] Issue #626: User Registration endpoint inconsistent in docs / swagger / Postman collection

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/626

**ANALYSIS**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is that the Swagger endpoint "user" was changed from "users" in commit #612, but not all endpoints were updated accordingly. This led to inconsistencies between the documentation (README.md), Postman collection (Conduit.postman_collection.json), and the actual API implementation.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce this bug:

1. Access the RealWorld API documentation.
2. Check the "Registration" section, which specifies that the endpoint is `POST /api/users`.
3. Open Postman and load the Conduit.postman_collection.json file.
4. Run the "Register a new user" request (POST /api/users).
5. Observe that the request fails with an error message.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

1. README.md (documentation)
2. Conduit.postman_collection.json (Postman collection)
3. swagger.json (Swagger endpoint definition)

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**
Test cases to prevent regression:

1. Verify that the Swagger endpoint "user" is updated to "users".
2. Run the "Register a new user" request in Postman and ensure it succeeds.
3. Check the documentation (README.md) to confirm that the registration endpoint is `POST /api/users`.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
Potential side effects:

1. Any existing API clients or integrations using the old "user" endpoint might need to be updated.
2. The Swagger definition should be reviewed and updated as needed to ensure consistency with the actual API implementation.

By applying this fix, we can resolve the issue and provide a consistent API experience for users.

### [BUG] Issue #525: JavaScript Attack

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/525

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of the issue is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user input in the backend API. Specifically, the `image` property in the `author` object is not being properly sanitized or validated, allowing malicious users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

To reproduce the bug:

1. Send a request to the `/api/articles` endpoint with a malformed image URL that includes malicious JavaScript code.
2. The backend API will store this image URL in the database without proper validation or sanitization.
3. When another user views the article, the malicious JavaScript code will be executed, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

The affected code paths are:

* `apps\api\server\routes\api\users\index.post.ts`: This file is responsible for creating a new user and storing their profile information in the database.
* `apps\api\nitro.config.ts`: This file configures the Nitro server and sets up CORS headers.

```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

To prevent regression, test cases should be added to ensure that:

1. The `image` property is properly sanitized and validated.
2. Only whitelisted image extensions are allowed (jpg/jpeg, png, gif).
3. Malicious JavaScript code injection attempts are blocked.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

After implementing this fix, potential side effects to double-check include:

* Ensure that the validation logic does not break any existing functionality or introduce new bugs.
* Verify that the fix does not impact performance or scalability of the API.
* Confirm that the updated code is properly tested and validated before deployment.

By implementing these changes, we can ensure that our API is more secure and resilient to potential security threats.

### [BUG] Issue #410: Bug: Removing all tags in an Article requires an array with an empty string

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/410

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is that when `tagList` is an empty array, the API doesn't properly remove all tags from the article. This occurs because the code attempts to create or connect tags using the `connectOrCreate` method, which fails for empty arrays.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**
To reproduce the bug:

1. Send a POST request to the `/articles` endpoint with an empty `tagList` in the request body.
2. Observe that the API doesn't remove all tags from the article.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**
The affected code paths are:

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/articles/index.post.ts`
* `apps/api/server/utils/article.mapper.ts`

 };
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Send a POST request with an empty `tagList` and verify that all tags are removed.
2. Send a POST request with a non-empty `tagList` and verify that the API creates or connects the specified tags.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**
This fix may have unintended consequences if there's existing functionality relying on the original behavior of the `connectOrCreate` method for empty arrays. Reviewing the codebase and testing thoroughly is essential to ensure this change doesn't introduce regressions.

### [BUG] Issue #373: NewUser definition email field has no format property set

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/373

**GitHub Issue Analysis Task**

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of the issue is that the `email` field in the `NewUser` definition does not have a `format` property set, which means it does not have any validation for email addresses. This allows users to register with any string as an email address, which is considered a bug.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

1. Try to register a new user with an invalid email address (e.g., `jake123` instead of `jake@example.com`) in the signup form.
2. Observe that the registration process does not raise any errors or warnings, and the user is successfully created.

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

* `apps/api/server/routes/api/v2/auth/signup.post.ts`: This file contains the code for handling the signup request.
* `apps/documentation/src/content/docs/specifications/frontend/templates.md`: This file contains the template for the registration form.
* `apps/api/server/routes/api/users/index.post.ts`: This file contains the code for validating usernames and emails during registration.

  });

  if (existingUserByEmail || existingUserByUsername) {
```

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

1. Test that the `email` field in the `NewUser` definition has a `format` property set.
2. Test that invalid email addresses (e.g., `jake123`) are rejected during registration.
3. Test that valid email addresses (e.g., `jake@example.com`) are accepted during registration.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

1. If the validation is too strict, it may reject valid email addresses. Be cautious when implementing email validation to ensure it does not introduce false negatives.
2. Consider adding more advanced email validation, such as checking for domain names or specific patterns, depending on your requirements.

### [BUG] Issue #269: Functionality Testing

**URL:** https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues/269

Based on the provided code context and issue description, I'll perform a comprehensive bug analysis and solution.

**1. Root Cause Analysis:**

The root cause of the issue is likely related to the authentication mechanism used in the application. The problem might be caused by incorrect implementation or configuration of the JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication system.

**2. Step-by-Step Reproduction:**

To reproduce the bug, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the application using a valid username and password.
2. Navigate to the "Sign in/Sign up" page.
3. Click on the "Sign out" button.
4. Attempt to access any protected route (e.g., /#/editor).

**3. Affected Code Paths:**

The affected code paths are likely:

* `apps\api\server\routes\api\articles\index.post.ts`: This file is responsible for handling article creation and authentication.
* `apps\documentation\src\content\docs\specifications\frontend\routing.md`: This file defines the routing specifications for the frontend.

**4. Complete Fix (Patch):**

Here's a potential fix as a git diff:
```diff
--- apps/api/server/routes/api/articles/index.post.ts
+++ apps/api/server/routes/api/articles/index.post.ts

   const { article } = await readBody(event);

   // ... (rest of the code remains the same)

   if (!auth) {
     throw new HttpException(401, "Unauthorized");
   }
```
This fix adds an authentication check before processing the request. If the user is not authenticated, it throws a 401 Unauthorized error.

**5. Test Cases to Prevent Regression:**

To prevent regression, add test cases that validate:

1. Successful login and authentication.
2. Failed login attempts (e.g., incorrect password).
3. Correct handling of logout requests.
4. Proper redirect after successful sign out.

**6. Potential Side Effects:**

When implementing this fix, consider the following potential side effects:

* Ensure that the `authenticate` function is properly configured and working correctly.
* Verify that the authentication mechanism is properly implemented and secured.
* Check for any potential issues with session management or caching.

By addressing these concerns and implementing the suggested fix, you should be able to resolve the reported bug and ensure a more secure and reliable application.
